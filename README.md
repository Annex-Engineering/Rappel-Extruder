This is the Rappel Extruder, a Fork of Mobius3.1. It's a dual geared hobbed filament extruder designed for use with any printer. It features a 4:1 belt driven design to provide torque while being able to be near silent.  It has been tested to work with most flexibles in a Bowden configuration. You must perform your own tuning to get the best results.

A Pancake or slightly larger stepper is recommended, torque should not exceed 36ozin for best performance.
