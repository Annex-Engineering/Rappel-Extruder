This is the Rappel Extruder, a Fork of Mobius3.1. It's a dual geared hobbed filament extruder designed for use with any printer. It features a 4:1 belt driven design to provide torque while being able to be near silent.  It has been tested to work with most flexibles in a Bowden configuration. You must perform your own tuning to get the best results.

A Pancake or slightly larger stepper is recommended. Heavily depending on bowden length.

The light gray and green is the standard orientation, the dark gray and green is the mirror orientation (in the cad models)

Starting eSTEPs at 1/16 microstepping with a 1.8deg stepper are approximate 571 steps per mm
